##Description
This game was designed to be a web-based game.  Users select cards to find
matching pairs.  Upon finding all matching pairs, the modal will display a
Congratulations screen with the number of moves, time, and star rating.

##Instruction for Gameplay
For offline gameplay, all files must be downloaded
https://github.com/redvalkyrie/memory-game
In order to start the game offline, the user must run index.html.  The file will
then open, and the game will run in a browser window. Users must click cards in
order to open them.  A minimum of 16 moves will be required for completion of
gameplay (all pairs matched first attempt).  Upon completion of the game, a
modal will pop up containing the time it took for completion, the star
rating(1-3 stars), and the time it took to complete the game.  The user may
click the "Play Again" button if they wish to play additional games.  Please note
that all cards are randomized each game. If the user wishes to restart the game
without completing it, click the replay button located on the upper right side
above the deck.
