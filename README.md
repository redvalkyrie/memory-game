## Synopsis
This game was designed to be a web-based game.  Users select cards to find
matching pairs.  Upon finding all matching pairs, the modal will display a
Congratulations screen with the number of moves, time, and star rating. Users
must click cards in order to open them.  A minimum of 16 moves will be required
for completion of gameplay (all pairs matched first attempt).  Upon completion
of the game, a modal will pop up containing the time it took for completion, the
star rating(1-3 stars), and the time it took to complete the game.  The user may
click the "Play Again" button if they wish to play additional games.  Please note
that all cards are randomized each game. If the user wishes to restart the game
without completing it, click the replay button located on the upper right side
above the deck.
